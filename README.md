Application of Geoinformatics technology for Mapping Air Pollution

## Overview

1. To visualize air pollution level
2. To analyze the risk area that could affect public health

## Software
* QGIS Desktop 2.18
* SQLyog Community
* PostGIS, PostgREST
* Google Earth Pro
## Data
* Dust particles (pm2_5value, pm10_value)
* Coorinates (latitude and longitude)
* Date and time (timestamp)
* Houses/parcel map (Google Earth Pro)

## Methodology

* Create houses/parcel map using Google Earth Pro.
* Import data into PostGIS database management software.
* Visualize air pollution levels in QGIS software
* Analyze air pollution using spatial operations, such as union and intersection.
* Intersect the result with the parcel map to find the risk areas.
