Application of Geoinformatics technology for Mapping Air Pollution

## Overview

# 1 To visualize air pollution level
# 2 To analyze the risk area that could affect public health

## Tools and data

# 1.Software
        * QGIS Desktop 2.18
        * SQLyog Community
        * PostGIS, PostgREST
        * Google Earth Pro
# 2.Data
        * Dust particles (pm2_5value, pm10_value)
        * Coorinates (latitude and longitude)
        * Date and time (timestamp)
        * Houses/parcel map (Google Earth Pro)

## Methodology

1. Create houses/parcel map using Google Earth Pro.
# 2.Import data into PostGIS database management software.
# 3.Visualize air pollution levels in QGIS software
# 4.Analyze air pollution using spatial operations, such as union and intersection.
# 5.Intersect the result with the parcel map to find the risk areas.
